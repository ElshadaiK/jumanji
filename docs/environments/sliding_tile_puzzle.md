This is a Jax JIT-able implementation of the classic [Sliding Tile Puzzle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle).

The Sliding Tile Puzzle game is a classic puzzle that challenges a player to slide (typically flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration. The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colors, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.

The puzzle is often 3Ã—3, 4Ã—4 or 5Ã—5 in size and made up of square tiles that are slid into a square base, larger than the tiles by one tile space, in a specific large configuration. Tiles are moved/arranged by sliding an adjacent tile into a position occupied by the missing tile, which creates a new space. The sliding puzzle is mechanical and requires the use of no other equipment or tools.

## Observation

The observation in the Sliding Tile Puzzle game includes information about the puzzle, the position of the empty tile, and the action mask.

- `puzzle`: jax array (int32) of shape `(grid_size, grid_size)`, representing the current game state. Each element in the array corresponds to a puzzle tile. The tile represented by 0 is the empty tile.

  - Here is an example of a random observation of the game board:

        ```
        [[ 1 2 3 4]
         [ 5 6 7 8]
         [ 9 10 0 12]
         [ 13 14 15 11]]
        ```
  - In this array, the tile represented by 0 is the empty tile that can be moved.

- `empty_tile_position`: a tuple (int32) of shape `(2,)` representing the position of the empty tile in the grid. For example, (2, 2) would represent the third row and the third column in a zero-indexed grid.

- `action_mask`: jax array (bool) of shape `(4,)`, indicating which actions are valid in the current state of the environment. The actions include moving the empty tile up, right, down, or left. For example, an action mask `[True, False, True, False]` means that the valid actions are to move the empty tile upward or downward.

## Action

The action space is a `DiscreteArray` of integer values in `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Specifically, these four actions correspond to moving the empty tile: up (0), right (1), down (2), or left (3).

## Reward

The reward function is -1 for each step until the puzzle is solved, at which point the episode ends. The goal is to solve the puzzle in the minimum number of steps.
